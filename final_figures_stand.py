Aim: This file is to plot final figures in paper.
There are 8 figures in paper.
recalculate the India precipitation here
1) precipitation regress onto SASMR, observation and MME, 1979-2014
2) circulation regress onto SASMR, observation and MME, 1979-2014, 200/500/850hPa
3) taylor-diagram including 200hPa pcc and 850hPa pcc
4) precipitation regress onto SASMR, gMME, 1979-2014 & 2064-2099 & diff
5) circulation regress onto SASMR, gMME, 1979-2014 & 2064-2099 & diff, 200/500/850hPa
6) divergence at 200 hPa and 850 hPa & omega at 500 hPa, all of them regress onto SASMR, gMME for the periods of 1979-2014 and 2064-2099
7) bar plots that show the WAAC, EAAC and WNPAC in all 26 models, gMME and MME in the period of 1979-2014 & 2064-2099 & diff
8) Sea surface temperature regress onto SASMR, observation and gMME, 1979-2014 & 2064-2099 & diff
